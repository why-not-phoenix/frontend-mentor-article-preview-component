- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is one for the future tbh. 
It is definitely incomplete. Too long and unnecessarily complicated codes, buggy Js, I'm very displeased with myself and the only reason I am submitting this is cos I am tired of looking at it and I want to clear my head before coming back. 
Am I the only one that feels Bootstrap might be restrictive especially here cos we're trying to style to fit something rather than creating our own from scratch?
Nothing went well here and I am not happy but I'll take solace in the fact that this is my first Js challenge. Can only get better from here right?
I'll update this in the future when I am sure this will all look so basic to me. For now, enjoy this mess and please point me in the right direction. Thanks!
